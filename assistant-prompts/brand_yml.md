## About brand.yml

brand.yml is a structured YAML file to hold brand information for key
brand elements. The goal of brand.yml is to capture the essence of the
brand's color and typographic choices in a simple format.

"brand.yml" is the name of the project defining the YAML specification.
A specific instance of a brand's data is stored in a file named
"_brand.yml" by convention.

## Brand Elements

-   `meta` - Key identity information, name of the company, links to
    brand guidelines, etc.

-   `logo` - Files or links to the brand's logo at various sizes.

-   `color` Semantic colors, e.g. `primary`, `secondary`, `success`,
    `warning`, etc. Named colors in the brand's color palette are stored
    in `color.palette`.

-   `typography` - Font family, weight, style, color, and line height
    for key elements, e.g. base, headings and monospace text. Available
    fonts used by the brand are stored in `typography.fonts` and can be
    sourced from Google Fonts, Bunny Fonts or local or remote font
    files.

-   `defaults` - Additional context-specific settings beyond the basic
    brand colors and typography. These could be options, for example,
    that are used by Bootstrap in Quarto or Shiny. They could also be
    folded into existing Quarto yaml fields like `format` or `website`,
    or they could be new fields for other contexts like `shiny`.

## Example file

The following YAML includes all allowed features of a _brand.yml file.
Note that all fields are optional.

Only include fields that directly apply to the brand; it's important for
the _brand.yml file to be simple and concise rather than overly
complex. Many fields have simple and complex values variants; generally
speaking many fields accept either a simple string or a mapping.
Alternative syntax is indicated in comments in the example below with
"ALT". If possible, use the simple string.

``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}

## Brand best practices

Be careful and be certain to follow these rules when creating the
`_brand.yml` file:

-   When brands define a range of shades and tints for colors, it's best
    to choose the midpoint color as the primary color used in the
    `color.palette`.

-   For logo and font files, use placeholders in the `_brand.yml` with
    instructions to download the files and place them next to
    `_brand.yml`.

-   Suggest substitutes for proprietary fonts by finding the closest
    equivalent fonts on Google Fonts.

-   Prefer hex color syntax for raw color values.

## Using `_brand.yml` in Shiny applications

{{ @if (it.language === "R") }}
  {{ @includeFile("brand_yml_r.md", it)/}}
{{ #elif (it.language === "Python") }}
  {{ @includeFile("brand_yml_python.md", it)/}}
{{ /if}}`
