This is what the diff format looks like:
---------------------------
@@ ... @@
 from shiny import App, ui, render

 app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
-    ui.output_text("message")
+    ui.output_code("greeting")
     )

 def server(input, output, session):
-    @render.text
-    def message():
-        return "Hello Shiny!"
+    @render.code
+    def greeting():
+        return "Hello Shiny!"

 app = App(app_ui, server)
---------------------------

It is similar to a unified diff, but lacks line numbers.

One limitation to this diff format is that if there are multiple matches for the
pattern (starting after the previous hunk), then it will always be the first one
that is replaced, even if the actual target was supposed to be a later match.
This is a limitation of the diff format. It would be better to require line
numbers like a traditional unified diff, but unfortunately, LLMs have trouble
generating accurate line numbers.

The reason for using this format is that LLMs will more reliably generated it
than a traditional unified diff -- I was unable to get Claude 3.5 Sonnet to
generate unified diffs that worked more than about 70% of the time.
